## Intro

Welcome to the Azure Security Podcast where we discuss topics relating to security, privacy, reliability and compliance on the Microsoft Cloud platform.

## Audio

**Michael**: Hey everybody, welcome to episode #9. We have the whole gang here this week. We have a guest Marianne Rahmani who is a senior manager with the security partner development team to talk to us about governance, risk and compliance. But before we get stuck into that let's start with the news. Mark, what do we have?

**Mark**: You had some interesting stuff on one of the things that I've been thinking about a lot lately and it sort of came up again, was how important threat modeling. It's a little bit less news. A little more insight. The thing that I've noticed is that like everybody, kind of had a similar architectures, when you look at how we did security is sort of the on premise world and you know we had sites. We have managed firewall or Ingress Egress Firewall, however going to call it and you know then we had all the apps and servers and all that on their virtualization. Didn't really change much so security's been kind of living in the same.
Architecture and sort of defacto threat model for a long time and then all of a sudden we we starting to see more and more organizations embracing platform as a service or pass PS types of applications and all the services. And they're doing mashups and APIs and software as a service. You know sometimes as well. So all of a sudden what we assumed the network would look like in an enterprise environment would look like is not what we're actually seeing in terms of the apps in the overall environment. It's changing.

And it's you know I'm starting to see more and more that we have to dust off skills that some of us have had for some folks knew how to do a threat model like we have to look at the system. An look at how it's architected an ask these questions about hey, how would an attacker attack this? And here's all the list of ways that they could. Now, let's prioritize this, figure it out and then mitigate the most important ones, right?
So we're starting to see like threat modeling coming back as a theme that. I mean, I haven't seen as a dominant theme when it's been on and off for like 1015 years. And so that's one of the things I've noticed like and there's also an insight that was interesting to me, which was.
We were actually starting to see some of the limitations of threat modeling because we were actually Michael. You and I were on this, this call the Azure Lighthouse Team was getting request for hey, can you? Our customers want a threat model? Can you help us build one? And for those that aren't familiar, Azure lighthouse is a service that allows MSP S which he is going to be talking about a little bit in a little bit here, but it allows service providers, managed Security Service providers to go ahead and.
You know manage or managed service providers in general to manage multiple customer tenants so they can have you know 1020 thirty hundreds, even customers on Azure and they do the management for them and provide that service and so.
When we took a look at that were like how do you threat model something like that when the customer chooses what they delegate to the service provider and then the service writer really has a lot of flexibility as well. And how they actually delegate among their people? And so it's actually challenging and we realize that a threat model didn't quite fit that scenario is actually better to think about it in terms of and we're working with them to develop a shared responsibility model, because that allows you to deal with that flexibility now if it was a concrete system in a very specific thing and we're looking into a couple of reference points of that reference configurations for Azure Sentinel and others.
You can actually do threat modeling on that because you've made decisions and you can ask a Security question. Get a concrete answer back. It is really fascinating insight about how important one threat modeling is. But too sometimes it's not the Magic Bullet. It's not the actual answer for all things. That sort of an interesting insight for me this this week. The other thing is I'm doing a Azure top best practices event for local Tampa chapter of CSA cloud security alliance. So because now everything is virtual.
Anybody can attend so I will put the link out there for that.
And then the last piece is. Notice some news where some more brands were getting hit by Ransomware attacks where domain admins. In this case we're specifically or enterprise admins were specifically cited as one of the causes, and so I just want to make sure it is a public service announcement. Share our privilege access Rd map out once again because it is very important to be addressing risks to those very, very high privilege accounts. So will put a link for that on the show notes as well. That's all I got.
I got a couple of items. The first one is to do with the revocation of some non compliance individual authorities. There were some issues not knowing all the details. There's going to be linked in the show notes. Digicert had a couple of issues with their Richard if it's and so we basically revoked those or they have been revoked and that has actually has some impact. If you're using some digital certificates, again, there's a link in the show notes, so if you're using things like API management, application gateway.
As you see, the end front door 80 proxy or app services and you have a certificate from Digicert. You've got some little action item he needs to look at. The other one is we talked about this a few months ago. There's customer managed key support for my SQL an for postgres SQL or that is now no longer in preview. It is now publicly available so that's really great news. Again, you'll see a lot of trends across Azure with customer managed key support database systems.
As well as more fine tune support for TLS and TLS 1.2 specifically, and that's what I got.
Couple of things this week. My big the number one piece of news I have this week is that we now have line numbers in the Log Analytics query editor, so if you've been using log analytics or sent and all that sits on top of log Analytics, all the queries didn't have line numbers. So if you were making errors with your queries which I frequently do.
It would tell you what line it was on, but you would actually have to count. So now we actually have. We tell you whether what line it's on an there's an actual line number which will help you debug your queries in log analytics, which is a very good thing.
The other log analytics thing that we have is now. If you're if you're using system center is now going to Bladen Log Analytics, which means if you're using scom instances connected into log analytics from from your environment, you've now got it in a separate blade and you can get visibility of what's going on there in little bit clearer fashion, which is nice. And then the last thing that I was going to talk about.
Is right now this week when we're recording this, it is cube con EU virtual coupon was of course supposed to be back in March in Amsterdam, but as most things this year that hasn't quite gotten to plan. And now coupon is hosting a virtual event I'm presenting. I'm going to panel actually tomorrow. My time. Unfortunately it's at 3:00 o'clock in the morning. My time down time zones as usual. All the big Kubernetes players are there, including Microsoft.
And you can go visit the you can go visit the team on the virtual booth and talk to them about AK S and some of the other cool open source things that we do in the Kubernetes cloud native space. So if you didn't know Microsoft is the main organization that maintains things like helm and draft and brigade and the cloud native application bundle or seen app. So if you've ever played around with those go visit.
The team the guys on the girls who were on that team and go say hi and that's everything I have this week.
I'm gonna expand our little bit about 1 mark was talking regarding the manage and managed Security Service providers. Actually, Microsoft Intelligent Security Association or miss afford short has expanded to include managed Security Service providers and I I'm not going to talk much about it, but I'm really excited. If you have her previous forecast, you may Remember Me talking about Microsoft graph.
Security API how enables our uniform data schema and set of queries that allowed interconnection and Inter operation with other services. Both Microsoft and 3rd party vendors. Well, this is another type of work that we're doing to expand the type of opportunities that were given to partners. I'm pretty sure we're going to talk about it in a little bit. We marry him. The next news that I want to talk about is the amount of.
Guidance that Microsoft is releasing regarding security operations center and the latest blog is how to organize your security team devolution or cyber security roles and responsibilities. This is really important cause our services are automatically collecting, correlating, analyzing data and creating context, focus report that uncover the extent of incident in previous.
Type of service. Also tools normally those tasks were done manually, so now these tasks are being Auto May.
Did Orrin Ronan real near time, which means that a lot of processes are no longer perform by analysts, so Microsoft is releasing all those lessons learned and guidance from our own operations center will be providing a lot of links with our site.
So Next up we have our guest, Marianne welcome the podcast, Marianne. Why don't you spend a couple of moments to explain kind of what you do at Microsoft bit of explanation about the group that you're in and then will ask you a bunch of questions.
Well, thank you Michael. Thank you for inviting me to the podcast. I am with Microsoft security solution area. My particulare team is the security partner development team and what we do. We leverage the strength of our partners to help secure our customers. So what do I mean by that? We understand that security is a team sport.
And we believe in the power of collaboration. So we work with our strategic partners to drive customer satisfaction. We work on thought leadership. We work on Accelerat ING the adoption of Microsoft security compliance, an identity solutions and support our sellers on our global sales team to further support that customer.
When you look at our work with our partners it through the entire business development life cycle, which means that we work with the partners to build solutions together again to address the need of that customer as well as working with them to develop, go to market and then Co. Sell initiatives. The group works with Microsoft Strategic Partners. My particular focus is the public sector.
And and that's what we do.
So what is the role of partners in regards to this work in? How do they get involved? That's an excellent question as I said, security is a team sport, so Microsoft really understands that our customers have a choice when it comes to security, an often. Even on this podcast we've discussed how customers are looking at how to reduce their technical depth, how to
consolidate these frenzy of tools that they have, So what Microsoft does is it works very closely with partners. Some of these partners may be independent software vendors. In fact, in 2018 we launched Microsoft launch the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association with 26 members, and today we have more than 130 members, so some of our partners.
Definitely fall into that category. Other partners that I work with maybe the very large system integrators and other partners may be very niche managed service providers and or some may be managed Security Service providers. So each one of these partners have an area of expertise an help to address a need that that the market has and.
Recently, in fact, when I talk about MRSA, which is the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association, we were not announced the pilot program with the managed Security Service providers and through that program we are trying to expand the reach and scale of supporting the customer. Some of 'em that may be small medium corporations that really rely on the expertise and.
Skill set off these managed Security Service providers in order to be secure.
I gotta question for you 'cause I mean, I kind of want to tie into the governance risk and compliance it was mentioned earlier. Like what are the sort of top trends or the big things that you see that are kind of affecting our customers and the partner ecosystem when it comes to what we've just been discussing about how Microsoft Works with partners. We all know that security world is a dynamic world. Weather is the threat landscape that is evolving. Weather is the.
Regulation and compliance regimes that are changing and evolving change is constant. So to address your question, one of, for instance, recent regulations that has come up with in US and federal government, particularly Department of Defense, is what is known as cybersecurity maturity model certification. That was the Department of Defense, desire and focus to try to reduce the.
Vulnerability within the supply chain and so within that evolving you know landscape. We work with our partners not only through the awareness but also helping them with our solutions to be able to meet those those requirements.
So one thing you mentioned, cybersecurity maturity model. Can you sort of explain that a little bit more detail? Perhaps the five levels of security maturity as well as sort of where some of the some of the background standards that support them with the model. Again, cybersecurity maturity model certification as I said, is intended to improve the security posture of Defense Industrial base. We're looking at roughly about 300,000 enterprises.
That our commercial companies that contract with the Department of Defense and they have to have enhanced protection to safe, keep and protect what is known as controlled, unclassified information. And so CMC has been put together by the Department of Defense in order for them to have an ability to make informed decisions based.
On the risk level of these companies that they would be procuring with CMC when it came about, it basically is building on existing regular regulations that the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement. The default 7012 has been in place before to address the controlled unclassified information safekeeping, but in the past it was based on the self.
Attestation, but now with CMC no longer can be just rely on a company that says I comply, but actually there will be auditors that go these third party assessors organizations that have to go and actually audit and say that a particular company is either level one level 2 Level 3 all the way to level 5 now.
These levels are all built on each other, so level one is basically a basic, you know security. It says that you have basic cyber hygiene and that is typically where you have to start. And that means that you're dealing with the federal contract information and it's really based on the federal acquisition regulation clause 52204 dash 21. That in itself has 17.
Particulare you know practices then some companies have to then be compliant to level 2 because they are getting to deal with a little bit more sensitive in formation. They're not there yet. By that I mean the controlled unclassified information, but they are transitioning to that, so they have to meet the level 2 and that level 2 now has 72 practices. So you see that they keep building on each other. Level 3 is where there are a lot of focus.
Because that's where you actually have to show that you're protecting the controlled unclassified information in the world before CMC. And actually, it's still on going until the rule change is finalized. There is a National Institute of standards and technology special publication 800, dash 171, which per defense federal acquisition regulation supplement the defaults. I'm using a lot of Acronyms. I'm trying to spell it out.
7012 actually requires companies that touch controlled, unclassified information to meet the controls. All 110 controls that are specified in this 171. What's the MMC? Did it actually introduced twenty additional controls? So now we're looking at 130 total controls that a company has to comply with in order to be able to have the right to procure with the Department of Defense.
So this is extremely important. Majority of the companies that.
Are looking to in that defense industrial base to procure with the Department of Defense have to go through this very small sliver of them, maybe percent or so or less than that potentially will need to meet levels for an 5 which basically say level. For that you're proactively practicing cybersecurity and level 5, which is extremely expensive. An advanced says that you actually have advanced than proactive measures in place.
So, so that's basically the CMC an it's an it's level.
And one other thing that I wanted to mention this, what is very interesting about CMC is that it is built on not only National Institute of standards and technologies, but also on some of best practices and standards that are coming from other places like the United Kingdom or Australia. And so it's definitely expensive.
Cool, I'm so what's Microsoft doing to help customers prepare for all of these changes in these things? These regimes that are coming in so Microsoft is working on a getting our own product certified. But also we are focused on helping our customers. So what we did is we issued series of logs. In fact there was a blog that was written by Lily Kim.
Which talked about our a program that we're putting together which is called CMC accelleration program. And that is really meant to help you know companies that want to leverage the power of cloud in the shared responsibility model to be able to, you know, meet some of those controls that I've touched on. And then there was two additional and recently very recently as of today and additional.
So now it makes it three additional blogs that we have issued an we talk about more from an educational perspective. Different areas that are of our interest to our customers, about CMC and how they can go about implementing these controls. And one thing that I have to say, so we definitely are focusing on leveraging. As I said partners to help us to get the word out.
And help the ecosystem to meet the Department of Defense requirements. So partners will definitely play a big role and managed service partners are come to mind that that are important. And earlier both Mark and Gladys touched on as an example on Azure Sentinel, so that definitely plays a role in terms of product that can help manage Security Service providers.
To help in this space.
So what is the timeline for the program and when is the CMC gonna be available?
So there, um, from a Microsoft perspective, there are several variables, including when our Microsoft product certification happens. Our intention is to release the CMC Accelleration program after Microsoft product assessment is done and so that is really subject to that timeline.
But Meanwhile we are, as I said, We are really doing a lot of campaign of awareness, an talking about best practices and participating in different venues. An educating an you know, being involved in the dialogue with the with the community.
So I think if you touched on this a little bit, but are there implications of CMC on entities outside of the US?
Yes, and that varies based on the industry and the country. As an example, Canada is setting up their certified third party assessor organization at the country level, whereas in Denmark they are actually doing it something slightly differently and they're right now sort of looking at their national approach and the one thing that I have to say, we still have time 'cause.
The rule change is in the process and it's on going as I touched on, we ourselves, along with a lot of our folks in the ecosystem we attend. You know different events that various people from the Department of Defense participate in, and in one of these recent events, miss Katie Arrington, who's the chief information security officer in the office of the Under Secretary of defense for acquisition and Sustainment, said that.
They are still even with pandemic there's still expecting to have the CMC requirements in their first couple of solicitations around September, October time frame, and we are still there still targeting around 7500 companies to be certified in 2021. So the work is in progress. There are a lot of focus on this topic, and ultimately it is expected that it would be included in every one of the contracts.
By 2026, and if you don't have the right levels, you won't be able to procure with the Department of Defense.
Thank you, Mariam. If there's one item that you could leave our listeners with, what would it be? You know to me everything I do when it comes to security. It's really personal to me. It's a calling and I do what I can. Almost passionate about it, but to to do what I can to help my fellow citizens, our nation, our communities safe and secure on the digital domain. And so.
Whenever I get on a public forum, I really call on like minded people to adopt security and privacy consideration in everything they do. So we are working for Microsoft. We have that mindset. We believe in maintaining trust in our platform and all we do. But I also want to make sure that I call like minded people to do the same because again, security is everyone's business and it is a team sport.
Hey Mary, I'm thank you so much for stopping by to join us on the podcast. We're really appreciate it and thank you to all of you for listening. We hope you find this podcast useful. Stay safe and we'll see you next time.
